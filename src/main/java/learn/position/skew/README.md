# Skew
1. Skew can arise from asymmetric order flow, liquidity imbalances, or market participant behavior.
2. In a perfectly efficient market with symmetric bid-ask spreads, the skew (as defined in the previous examples) will always be zero
3. Use the skew signals to develop a trading strategy. For example:
If skew is positive, consider a long position (buying pressure).
If skew is negative, consider a short position (selling pressure).
